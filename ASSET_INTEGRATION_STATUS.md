# Asset Integration Status

## Integration Plan

Based on my recommendations, I'll integrate:

1. ✅ **Player:** Wizard sprite (PixelAntasy)
2. ✅ **Enemy:** PixelAntasy goblin (for consistency with wizard style)
3. ✅ **Backgrounds:** Fantasy backgrounds
4. ✅ **Projectiles:** Fireball/iceball sprites

## Implementation Approach

For initial integration, I'll:
- Start with **static sprites** (single frame) to get assets visible in-game quickly
- Replace ColorRect placeholders with Sprite2D nodes
- Set up proper scaling to match game size (32x32 or 64x64)
- Configure import settings for pixel art

Animations can be added later as a follow-up task.

## Next Steps

1. Replace player ColorRect with wizard sprite
2. Replace enemy ColorRect with goblin sprite  
3. Replace background with fantasy background image
4. Replace spell projectile visuals with fireball/iceball sprites
5. Test in-game and adjust scaling/positioning
6. Update documentation

**Status:** Starting integration now...
