# Quick Tileset Setup Guide

## Step 1: Save Your Tileset Images

1. **Save your PNG files** to this folder:
   ```
   godot-project/assets/sprites/environment/dungeons/tilesets/
   ```

2. **Name them clearly:**
   - `dungeon_tileset_01.png`
   - `dungeon_tileset_02.png`
   - `dungeon_tileset_03.png`
   - (or any names you prefer)

## Step 2: Tell Me When They're Saved

Once the files are in that folder, just say:
> "The tileset files are saved, process them"

And I'll:
- ✅ Create TileSet resources
- ✅ Extract individual sprites
- ✅ Set up animations
- ✅ Create example scenes

## Alternative: Save Anywhere

If you save them somewhere else in your project, just tell me the path and I'll move them to the right place!

## What I'll Extract (Based on Your Tilesets)

### Tileset Elements:
- Dark stone walls → TileSet for level building
- Wooden platforms/stairs → TileSet or sprites
- Waterfall → Animated sprite
- Torch → Animated sprite
- Doors → Individual prop sprites
- Barrels, crates, beds → Individual prop sprites
- Windows/grates → TileSet or sprites
- Character sprite → NPC sprite

**Just save the files and let me know!** 🎨
