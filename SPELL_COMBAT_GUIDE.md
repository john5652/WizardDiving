# Spell Combat Guide 🎮⚔️

## How to Use Spells

### Step 1: Collect Spells
- Fly into the glowing orbs to collect them
- Spells automatically equip to slots 1-4 (first empty slot)
- Watch the top-right UI to see which spells you have

### Step 2: Cast Spells
- **Press 1, 2, 3, or 4** to cast the spell in that slot
- **Spells fire in your movement direction** (where you're moving)
- If you're not moving, spells fire in the direction you're facing
- There's a small cooldown between casts (0.3 seconds)

### Step 3: Fight the Goblin
1. **Collect at least one combat spell** (Fireball or Ice Shard)
2. **Move toward the goblin** while pressing the spell key (1 or 2)
3. **Keep moving** - the goblin will chase you
4. **Watch the goblin's health bar** - it turns yellow/red as it takes damage
5. **The goblin will die** when its health reaches 0

## Tips for Combat

✅ **Movement-Based Aiming**: Spells fire where you're moving, so move toward enemies  
✅ **Keep Moving**: Don't stand still - the goblin will catch you  
✅ **Use Multiple Spells**: Different spells have different damage  
✅ **Watch Cooldowns**: You can't spam spells - wait a moment between casts  
✅ **Collect All Spells**: More spells = more options  

## Spell Types

- **Fireball** (Red) - 20 damage, good for combat
- **Ice Shard** (Blue) - 15 damage, good for combat  
- **Unlock Door** (Yellow) - Utility spell, not for combat

## Troubleshooting

**Spells not firing?**
- Make sure you've collected a spell first
- Check the top-right UI - it should show the spell name
- Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not the number pad)

**Spells not hitting the goblin?**
- Move toward the goblin when casting
- Spells fire in your movement direction
- Make sure you're close enough

**Goblin not taking damage?**
- Make sure you're using a combat spell (Fireball or Ice Shard)
- The goblin's health bar should change color when hit
- Keep casting - it takes multiple hits to kill

## Controls Summary

- **WASD/Arrows** - Move (spells fire in this direction)
- **1-4** - Cast spell from that slot
- **Space** - Interact with doors/objects

Enjoy the combat! 🎯
