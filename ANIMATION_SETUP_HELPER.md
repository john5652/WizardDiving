# Animation Setup Helper

Setting up AnimatedSprite2D with SpriteFrames programmatically is complex. Here's the approach:

## Current Status
- ✅ Scale increased (2.0 for wizard, 1.8 for goblin)
- ✅ Background texture loading added
- ⏳ Animations need to be set up

## Animation Setup Approach

I'll convert from Sprite2D to AnimatedSprite2D and create SpriteFrames resources with:
- Idle animation (using walk frames or static sprite)
- Walk animation (8 frames)
- Run animation (8 frames)

Let me implement this now!
