# Asset Integration In Progress

I'm currently integrating the assets programmatically. This involves:

1. ✅ Updated player.gd script (ColorRect → Sprite2D)
2. ✅ Updated enemy.gd script (ColorRect → Sprite2D, color → modulate)
3. ⏳ Updating test_level.tscn scene file (complex, in progress)
4. ⏳ Updating spell_projectile.tscn
5. ⏳ Testing integration

Due to the complexity of .tscn files, I'm being careful with the formatting. Integration is proceeding step by step.
