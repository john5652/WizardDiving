# Quick Fix Guide - Common Issues

## Issue 1: "Spells not casting"

**How to cast spells:**
1. Collect a spell (fly into the glowing orb)
2. Check the top-right UI - it should show the spell name (e.g., "Fireball")
3. Press **1, 2, 3, or 4** to cast the spell in that slot, OR
4. Press **TAB** to switch spells, then **SPACE** to cast the selected spell
5. The spell fires in the direction you're moving

**If spells still don't work:**
- Make sure you've actually collected a spell (watch the console for "✓ Collected spell")
- Check the top-right UI shows the spell name
- Try pressing the NUMBER KEYS (1-4) or SPACE after selecting with TAB
- Move while casting (spells fire in movement direction)
- Make sure the game isn't paused (press ESC to check)

## Issue 2: "Goblin blocks my movement"

**Fixed!** The enemy should no longer block you. If it still does:
- The enemy will now push away when you get too close
- You can move through/around it more easily
- If still stuck, try moving diagonally

## Controls Reminder

- **WASD/Arrows** - Move
- **TAB** - Switch between equipped spells
- **1, 2, 3, 4** - Cast spell from that slot (also switches to that slot)
- **SPACE** - Cast currently selected spell
- **E** - Interact with doors/objects
- **ESC** - Pause menu

## Testing Checklist

✅ Collect a spell - should see "✓ Collected spell" in console  
✅ Check top-right UI - should show spell name  
✅ Press 1 or 2 (number keys) - should fire projectile  
✅ Move toward goblin while pressing 1/2 - should hit it  
✅ Goblin should not block your movement  

If something still doesn't work, check the console for error messages!
