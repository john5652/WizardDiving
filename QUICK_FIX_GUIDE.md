# Quick Fix Guide - Common Issues

## Issue 1: "Nothing happens when I pick up a spell and hit space bar"

**Solution:** Space bar is NOT for casting spells! 

- **Space bar** = Interact with doors/objects only
- **Number keys 1-4** = Cast spells

**How to cast spells:**
1. Collect a spell (fly into the glowing orb)
2. Check the top-right UI - it should show the spell name (e.g., "Fireball")
3. Press **1, 2, 3, or 4** (the number key, not space!)
4. The spell fires in the direction you're moving

**If spells still don't work:**
- Make sure you've actually collected a spell (watch the console for "✓ Collected spell")
- Check the top-right UI shows the spell name
- Press the NUMBER KEYS (1-4), not space bar
- Move while casting (spells fire in movement direction)

## Issue 2: "Goblin blocks my movement"

**Fixed!** The enemy should no longer block you. If it still does:
- The enemy will now push away when you get too close
- You can move through/around it more easily
- If still stuck, try moving diagonally

## Controls Reminder

- **WASD/Arrows** - Move
- **1, 2, 3, 4** - Cast spells (NOT space!)
- **Space** - Interact with doors only

## Testing Checklist

✅ Collect a spell - should see "✓ Collected spell" in console  
✅ Check top-right UI - should show spell name  
✅ Press 1 or 2 (number keys) - should fire projectile  
✅ Move toward goblin while pressing 1/2 - should hit it  
✅ Goblin should not block your movement  

If something still doesn't work, check the console for error messages!
