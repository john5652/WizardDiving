# How to Check Asset Sizes - Quick Guide

This guide explains **how to figure out asset sizes** and reassures you that **exact sizes aren't critical** - I can adjust them!

## 🎯 The Most Important Thing First

**You don't need to worry about perfect sizes!**

- If an asset is 48x48 instead of 32x32 → **That's fine!** I can resize it
- If an asset is 64x64 instead of 32x32 → **That's fine!** I can resize it  
- If an asset is 24x24 instead of 32x32 → **That's fine!** I can resize it
- If assets are slightly different sizes → **That's fine!** I can make them consistent

**Any pixel art is better than colored rectangles!** Just download assets you like, and I'll handle the sizing.

## 📏 How to Check Asset Sizes

### Method 1: Check the Asset Page (Before Downloading)

Most asset pages on OpenGameArt.org will tell you the size:

**Look for:**
- Title/description: "32x32 pixel art", "64x64 sprites"
- Image preview: Often shows dimensions
- File list: File names sometimes include size (e.g., `character_32x32.png`)
- Comments/discussion: Users often mention sizes

**Example from a typical page:**
- "This pack includes 32x32 pixel art characters"
- "Sprites are 64x64 pixels with transparent backgrounds"
- "Tiles are 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 versions included"

### Method 2: Check After Downloading (Windows)

#### Using Windows File Explorer:

1. **Open the folder** containing the downloaded asset
2. **Right-click on the image file**
3. **Select "Properties"**
4. **Go to the "Details" tab**
5. **Look for:**
   - "Dimensions" (e.g., "32 x 32")
   - "Width" and "Height"

#### Using Windows Photos/Image Viewer:

1. **Right-click the image file**
2. **Select "Open with" → "Photos"** (or your default image viewer)
3. **Right-click on the image** in the viewer
4. **Select "File info"** or look for properties
5. **Dimensions are usually shown**

#### Using File Explorer Preview Pane:

1. **Open File Explorer**
2. **Click "View" tab** → Check "Preview pane" (right side)
3. **Click on an image file**
4. **Look at the preview pane** - it often shows dimensions

## 🔍 Quick Size Identification Tips

### What Sizes Are Common?

- **16x16 pixels** - Very small, retro-style
- **24x24 pixels** - Small sprites
- **32x32 pixels** - **Most common for 2D games** (your target)
- **48x48 pixels** - Medium size
- **64x64 pixels** - Larger, more detail
- **96x96+ pixels** - Very detailed

### What to Look For:

✅ **Good signs:**
- Page says "32x32" or "32 pixel"
- Preview images look about right
- File names include "32" or "32x32"
- Comments mention the size

❌ **Don't worry if:**
- Size isn't mentioned (download anyway!)
- Size is slightly different (24x24, 48x48, 64x64)
- You can't tell the size (download and check later)

## 📐 Your Game's Size Requirements (Flexible!)

Based on your game design:

| Asset Type | Ideal Size | Acceptable Range |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Player** | 32x32 or 64x64 | 24x24 to 96x96 (I can resize!) |
| **Enemies** | 24x24 to 32x32 | 16x16 to 64x64 (I can resize!) |
| **Background Tiles** | 16x16 or 32x32 | Any size (I can resize/tile them!) |
| **Spell Pickups** | 16x16 to 32x32 | Any size (I can resize!) |

**Remember:** All of these are flexible! If you find a great asset that's 48x48 instead of 32x32, that's perfectly fine.

## 🛠️ What I Can Do With Different Sizes

When you give me assets, I can:

1. **Resize them** to match your game's scale
2. **Maintain aspect ratio** (keep proportions correct)
3. **Use pixel-perfect scaling** (for pixel art - preserves sharp edges)
4. **Adjust game code** to accommodate different sizes
5. **Make all assets consistent** (scale everything to match)

**Example:**
- You download a 64x64 wizard sprite
- Your game expects 32x32
- I'll resize it to 32x32 using pixel-perfect scaling
- It will look great in your game!

## 🎨 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Player Sprite

**You find:** A wizard sprite that's 64x64 pixels
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I'll resize it to 32x32

**You find:** A character sprite that's 48x48 pixels  
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I'll resize it to 32x32

**You find:** A sprite that's 16x16 pixels (small)
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I'll scale it up to 32x32 (may look pixelated, but usable)

### Example 2: Enemy Sprite

**You find:** A goblin that's 32x32 pixels
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Perfect match!** Download it!

**You find:** A monster that's 40x40 pixels
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I'll resize it to 32x32

### Example 3: Background Tiles

**You find:** Tiles that are 16x16 pixels
**Your game needs:** 32x32 pixels
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I can either:
- Scale them up to 32x32
- Use them at 16x16 (smaller tiles = more detail)

**You find:** A background image that's 1920x1080 pixels (full screen)
**Your game needs:** Tiles
**Solution:** ✅ **Download it!** I can use it as a full background or crop tiles from it

## 🚀 Recommended Approach (Don't Overthink It!)

### My Recommendation:

1. **Don't stress about sizes** - Focus on finding assets you like
2. **Download assets that look good** - Art style matters more than exact size
3. **Check sizes after downloading** (if you're curious)
4. **Tell me what you've added** - I'll handle all the sizing

### What to Prioritize Instead:

✅ **Art style** - Does it match your game's fantasy/magical theme?
✅ **Quality** - Does it look good?
✅ **License** - Is it free to use? (CC0 or CC-BY are best)
✅ **Transparency** - Does it have transparent background? (for sprites)

❌ **Don't worry about:**
- Exact pixel dimensions
- Whether it's 32x32 or 48x48
- Perfect size matches

---

## 📋 Quick Checklist When Choosing Assets

When browsing for assets, ask yourself:

1. ✅ **Does it look good?** (Art style matches your game?)
2. ✅ **Is it free to use?** (Check license - CC0 or CC-BY)
3. ✅ **Is it pixel art?** (Not 3D or hand-drawn - unless you want that)
4. ❓ **What size is it?** (Nice to know, but not critical)

**If you answered "yes" to 1-3, download it!** Size is my problem to solve, not yours.

## 🔧 How I'll Handle Your Assets

When you tell me "I've added assets", here's what I'll do:

1. **Check the files** you've added
2. **Identify their sizes** (I can check this automatically)
3. **Resize if needed** to match your game
4. **Configure Godot** to use them properly
5. **Test in-game** to ensure they look good
6. **Make adjustments** if anything needs tweaking

**You don't need to:**
- Resize images yourself
- Check exact dimensions
- Worry about pixel-perfect matches
- Convert formats (unless it's really weird)

---

## 💡 Bottom Line

**Focus on finding assets you like, not perfect sizes.**

Any pixel art sprite between 16x16 and 96x96 pixels will work. I'll handle the rest!

**Just download assets that:**
- Look good
- Match your game's style
- Are free to use
- Are pixel art (2D)

**Then tell me what you've added, and I'll integrate them perfectly!**

---

## ❓ Still Not Sure?

If you're still worried about sizes, here's what to do:

1. **Download any asset you like** (between 16x96 pixels is fine)
2. **Place it in the appropriate folder**
3. **Tell me:** "I've added [asset name] to [folder], but I'm not sure about the size"
4. **I'll check it and let you know** if it needs resizing (and I'll do it!)

**Remember:** It's easier for me to resize an asset than for you to find the "perfect" size. Just download assets you like! 🎨
